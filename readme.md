# Intro
Problem from kattis competition, found it fun to make the comunication between Alice and Bob using processes stdin/stdout such that `alice.py` calls `bob.py`

# Problem 
Alice and Bob play a game called 99, Alice starts by saying the number 1 and then Bob and Alice take turns, starting with Bob, increasing this number by either 1 or 2. The first that says the number 99 wins the game

# Usage
```cmd
python alice.py
```
or 
```cmd
chmod +x alice.py
./alice.py
```
